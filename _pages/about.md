I am a PhD student in the Responsible Autonomy Intelligent Systems Ethics (RAISE) Lab in Electrical and Computer Engineering at McGill University. I am grateful to be a 2025 Pierre Elliot Trudeau Foundation Scholar and a Vadasz Doctoral Scholar and Fellow in McGill’s Faculty of Engineering.

Before my doctoral studies, I graduated with an MSc in Social Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford and a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Biomedical Engineering Co-operative Education program at the University of Guelph. 

Through diverse volunteer and industry experiences in software quality assurance, AI ethics organizations, and engineering education development, my doctoral research investigates socially-driven, context-specific AI evaluations, particularly among sociotechnical algorithmic auditing practices. Currently, my research projects are in collaboration with l'Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), l’Université de Montréal (UdeM), the University of Oxford, and Mila – Quebec AI Institute. I hope to contribute to forthcoming AI regulatory and policy movements in safety engineering, particularly in creating accountability mechanisms among actors in the Canadian AI ecosystem.

What am I currently up to?
======

Three research projects currently hold my attention:

🌟**General All-Purpose Sociotechnical Algorithmic Auditing Project:** In collaboration with Professor AJung Moon at McGill University and Dr. Dominic Martin and Dr. Sébastien Gambs at Université du Québec à Montréal, in addition to L'Observatoire international sur les impacts sociétaux de l'IA et du numérique (OBVIA). Following an extensive scoping review process of over 3,000 algorithmic evaluation articles, this work aims to consider the complexities and potential solutions for systems-level AI audits of general-purpose AI systems, including large language models, visual and audio models, and image-to-text models.

🌟**Gaps in Robotic/AI Governance:** In collaboration with Professor AJung Moon at McGill University, Dr. Pierre Larouche at the Université De Montréal, and Dr. Keri Grieman at the University of Oxford, this project intersects engineering, regulation, and law. It examines the regulatory gaps in AI and robotics in Canada and their implications. It aims to unpack the following: a) the unique nature of the robotics ecosystem in Canada and its relationship to the AI ecosystem; b) existing regulations and standards on responsible robotics internationally and in Canada; and c) critical governance gaps for embodied AI systems in Canada. A primary objective aims to bridge policymakers, robotics and AI industry actors, and academics across the two disparate but closely related fields through consultations with start-ups, SME, industry, academia, non-profits, and standards organizations.

🌟**Responsible AI Measures Project:** In collaboration with Shalaleh Rismani and Professor AJung Moon at McGill University, and Dr. Renee Shelby, and Dr. Negar Rostamzadehat at Google Research, as well as Mila - Quebec AI Institute. 

I also currently work for the **TRAIL program for Mila - Quebec AI Institute**, where I instruct the *Actionable Strategies for AI Impact Assessments* module.
